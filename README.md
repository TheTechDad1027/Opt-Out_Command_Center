In a world where personal data is widely spread online, the Opt-Out Command Center gives you a single place to manage your privacy. It helps you find and use opt-out options to remove your information from various online services and integrates with Outlook to let you quickly identify and unsubscribe from bulk or unwanted emails.

How It Works
Discover opt-out or data removal paths for common online services.
Open opt-out pages directly from the dashboard to submit removal or preference requests.
Connect to Outlook so the tool can scan your inbox for unsubscribe options by:
Detecting List-Unsubscribe headers commonly used in bulk or marketing mail.
Searching for keywords like "unsubscribe" or "manage your subscription" in the message body.
Looking for bulk-delivery indicators in headers (for example, flags that show an email was sent to a mailing list).
Use those signals to quickly unsubscribe from newsletters and other unwanted messages.
Why It Matters
Your privacy is important. Over time, your information can end up scattered across data brokers, marketing systems, and mailing lists. Opt-Out Command Center helps you take back control by bringing opt-out options and inbox cleanup tools into one place.

The tool is designed to speed up your privacy and inbox cleanup workflow, but it cannot guarantee full data removal or the complete end of spam. It is a helper to make manual and semi-automated privacy actions faster and easier.
